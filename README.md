# Capstone 
Time to build a predictive model for PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset with KNN, Logistic Regression and ANN.

The PIMA Indians diabetes dataset is one of the most popular machine learning quests for data scientists. It was introduced by Kaggle, courtesy of UCI Machine Learning Repository. The original dataset was collated by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 

# What is Required?
The task in hand is to build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not, based on specific medical diagnostic measurements.
